    Jsonnet gives us a lot of freedom to organize our libraries, there is no right or
    wrong, however a well-organized library can get you a long way. While applying common
    software development best-practices, we'll come up with an *extensible library* to
    deploy a webserver on Kubernetes.

    By following an object-oriented approach, it is possible to build extensible jsonnet
    libraries. They can be extended infinitely and in such a way that it doesn't impact
    existing uses, providing backwards compatibility.

    The pitfalls show a few patterns that exist in the wild but should be avoided and
    refactored as they become unsustainable in the long term.
